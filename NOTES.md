# NOTES

Log of decisions, deviations from PLAN.md, and every measured number.

## Environment (2026-11-02)

- Apple M5 Pro, 24 GB RAM, macOS (Darwin 27.0.0), APFS
- git 2.52.0, Node 22.22.2, npm 10.9.7, pnpm 12.11.2, yarn 1.22.22, bun 1.3.11
- No Rust toolchain installed yet (needed from Phase 1). Phase 0 is Node + tsgo only.
- npm `typescript` dist-tags: latest 7.0.2, beta 7.1.0-beta, next 7.1.0-dev.20261101.1

## Phase 0 — API probe (before task 0.1)

Installed `typescript@7.1.0-beta` (gitHead 3e9236361fa97a9e6c685f4833ac457ae2d8c50a) and probed a toy project.

- Entry points: `typescript/async` (`API`, `Snapshot`, `Project`, `Program`, `Checker`, `LanguageService`), `typescript/fs` (`createFileSystemLayer`, `createFileSystem`). Binary comes from `@typescript/typescript-<platform>` optionalDependency.
- `new API({ cwd })` spawns one tsgo per instance. `api.createSnapshot({ openProjects: [tsconfig] })` loads a configured project.
- `base.update({ fileSystem: createFileSystemLayer(files, { removedPaths }), ensurePrograms: true })` gives an agent snapshot: edits, added files (picked up by `include` globs) and removed files all behave correctly, and the base snapshot is unchanged afterwards. `api.createSnapshot({ fileSystem: layer, openProjects })` (independent) gives the same answers.
- **Gotcha:** without `ensurePrograms: true` the derived snapshot's program is the stale base program (no diagnostics change). Deviation from PLAN: every update must pass `ensurePrograms`.
- Diagnostics come back as `{ fileName, pos, end, startPosition?, code, category, text, messageChain?, relatedInformation? }`.
- **Per-snapshot language features in the API (no LSP-style hover/definition calls):**
  - diagnostics: `program.getSyntacticDiagnostics / getSemanticDiagnostics / getGlobalDiagnostics(file?)`
  - hover: build from `checker.getSymbolAtPosition` + `getTypeOfSymbol` + `typeToString` + `symbol.getDocumentationComment`
  - definition: `symbol.declarations` (node handles with `path`, `index`)
  - references: `languageService.getReferencedSymbolsForNode(node, pos)`, or `checker.getReferencesToSymbolInFile`
  - completions: `languageService.getCompletionsAtPosition`
  - symbols: walk the remote AST from `program.getSourceFile`
  - rename: not exposed

## Phase 0 — Task 0.1 fixtures

`bench/setup.sh` (idempotent). Fixtures live in `bench/fixtures/` (gitignored), shallow-fetched at pinned SHAs:

| Fixture | Repo @ SHA | Project checked | Package manager | Files in program | Lines |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| excalidraw | excalidraw/excalidraw @ 8bcdca4526867433f99fdfcb55a063668db0c9dc | `tsconfig.json` | yarn 1.22 | 1,519 | 461,394 |
| calcom | calcom/cal.com @ f972feefa1376cf47631177231c671da9a9dd09f | `apps/web/tsconfig.json` | yarn 4.12 (node-modules linker) | 10,445 | 1,456,736 |

TypeScript used by the harness: exactly `7.1.0-beta` (pinned in `bench/package.json`). Both repos ship on TS 5.9.3; tsgo ignores the repo's own `typescript` package for checking.

TS 7.1 migration fixes (`bench/patches/*.sh`, committed in each base as `strata: ts7.1 migration fixes`, so every worktree inherits them):

- excalidraw: removed `"baseUrl": "."` (TS5102). Paths were already `./`-relative. Result: **0 errors**.
- calcom `apps/web/tsconfig.json`: removed `baseUrl`, prefixed bare `paths` targets with `./` (TS5090), added `"*": ["./*"]` (the documented `baseUrl` replacement; bare imports such as `app/_utils` depend on it), and overrode `target: es2017` and `moduleResolution: bundler` because the inherited `@calcom/tsconfig` sets `es5` and `node` (TS5108, both removed in TS 7). Only `apps/web` was changed, not the shared configs.
- calcom post-install (`bench/patches/calcom.post.sh`): `prisma generate` (scripts are disabled during install) and `@calcom/trpc build:server` (apps/web imports the emitted router declarations; built with the repo's own TS 5.9.3, 11 s).
- calcom still reports **730 errors** under tsgo 7.1: ~300 TS2339 where tRPC's router type degrades to its "collides with a built-in method" error union (a TS 7 / `bundler` resolution difference, not investigated further), ~270 TS7006 implicit-any that cascade from it, plus jest-dom matcher typings and `@hookform/resolvers/zod` (TS7016). Per the plan, parity needs equal results, not zero errors. Consequence to keep in mind: tRPC inference partly collapses, so checker work on calcom is somewhat **understated** relative to a fully typed tree.
- Full `tsc --noEmit` memory (tsgo `--extendedDiagnostics`, one process): excalidraw ~1.0 GB, calcom ~2.5 GB.

Worktrees: `git worktree add -b agent-N`, then every git-ignored path in base (node_modules, Prisma output, tRPC declarations, `.yarn/cache`) is copied with `cp -c -R` (APFS clone). `bench/diff.mjs` applies a deterministic per-agent diff, committed as `strata: agent diff N`: 5 tracked .ts/.tsx files under the project root edited (appended helper functions; the first also gets a deliberate TS2322), 1 file added next to the first edit (imports it), 1 file deleted (importers then fail with TS2307). Each worktree's diff is different.
- Seeding timing (useful for Phase 4, not a Phase 0 gate): `cp -c -R` of every ignored path took ~10 s per excalidraw worktree and **~51 s per calcom worktree** (3.4 GB node_modules plus `.yarn/cache`), on an M5 Pro / APFS. `cp -c` clones file by file; Phase 4's single `clonefile` per directory should be much faster (pnpm #14041 reports 13.4 s for 213k files).
- cal.com's husky pre-commit hook (lint-staged, `biome lint` only, no `--write`) ran on the first diff commits; diffs were unaffected. `setup.sh` now commits with `--no-verify`.
